# Marble-Solitaire-Solver
Final project to fullfil the requirements for the AP Computer Science Principles test. First programed in 2020 when my AI knowledge was very limited. I couldn't go deeper than depth 1 and reinvented heuristics under the name "weighted priorities". Because of my inexperience the best I could do was get the marble game to win in certain starting poisitons. However recently I went back and made it work universally. I spent a lot of time with the aesthetics of the project back in 2020 and am proud of this project given my knowledge at the time.
