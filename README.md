# Marble-Solitaire-Solver
Description: 
Final project to fulfill the requirements for the AP Computer Science Principles test. Programed in spring 2020 when my AI knowledge was very limited. 
I couldn't go deeper than depth 1 and spent a very long time messing around with weighted move priorities (my term for hueristics at the time). 
Because of my inexperience the best I could do was get the marble game to win in certain starting poisitons. 
However this was a big project for me as it was my first experience with AI and conjuring hueristics.
What now seems like a simple task, I spent countless hours thinking about on end. Trying to come up with ideas for more priorities to finish 
with just one less stone. It was really fun to be able to put this much time and effort into a project and was a big step in my cs journey. 

How to use: 
In order to run the program simply download the python file and run it. 
You will need to input a runtime speed if you would like to see it go through the moves slowly or run at max speed is up to you. 
The program will spawn a full board and wait for the user to click the first marble to remove from the board. The solitaire begins with one empty square, 
so once the user has declared the starting positions it begins to play the game.
